Hello. I am a MEng graduate student in [ISTD Pillar](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg) at [Singapore University of Design and Technology](https://www.sutd.edu.sg), advised by [Alexander Binder](https://www.visual-intelligence.no/people/alexander-binder) and [Kwan Hui Lim](https://sites.google.com/site/limkwanhui/).
My current research is on interpretability with the focus on explainable artificial intelligence methods for deep learning.

I was also previously advised by [Yue Zhang](https://frcchang.github.io) and [Patrick Jaillet](http://web.mit.edu/jaillet/www/), with my study generously funded by [FM IRG](https://smart.mit.edu/research/fm/about-fm) at [Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology](https://smart.mit.edu).

Prior to my post-graduate study, I was a Research Engineer at [SIMTech](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/simtech) at [A\*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg).
Before that, I got my [BEng in Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/isem/undergraduate/admissions/) from the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg).
