Hello ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! I am a Data Scientist at [Garena](https://www.garena.sg), and I love to explore data-driven approaches to solve real-world problems.

I got my M.Eng. from [Singapore University of Design and Technology](https://www.sutd.edu.sg) [ISTD Pillar](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg), advised by [Alexander Binder](https://www.visual-intelligence.no/people/alexander-binder) and [Kwan Hui Lim](https://sites.google.com/site/limkwanhui/).
I did research on explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) methods for interpreting deep learning models.

I was also previously advised by [Yue Zhang](https://frcchang.github.io) and [Patrick Jaillet](http://web.mit.edu/jaillet/www/), with my study generously funded by [FM IRG](https://smart.mit.edu/research/fm/about-fm) at [Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology](https://smart.mit.edu).

Prior to my post-graduate study, I was a Research Engineer at [SIMTech](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/simtech) at [A\*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg).
Before that, I got my [B.Eng. in Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/isem/undergraduate/admissions/) from the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg).
